Separate Concerns:
Routes (routes.py): Handle the request and response logic. Import the necessary services to process the data.
Services (services.py): Contain the business logic, such as interacting with the chatbot or handling specific requests.
Models (models.py): Define data models (if using a database).
Utilities (utils.py): Any helper functions.
3. Modularize the Chatbot Workflow
Given the complexity of your workflow.py, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused modules within the chatbot/ directory. For example:

authentication.py: Handle authentication-related tasks.
balance.py: Handle account balance-related tasks.
transfer.py: Handle money transfer tasks.
4. Use a Service Layer to Interface with Chatbot
Your API routes should call services that manage interactions with the chatbot. This keeps your route handlers clean and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.
